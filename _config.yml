bio: "Brazilian developer. Game, music and technology lover. I graduated in Information Systems. 
      I love to study and learn new skills, exchange work and study experience with people around me 
      and share my knowledge with the ones that want it. I work with Web Development since 2014 as 
      Freelancer and in some Brazilian companies too. I like to work with both: Front-End and Back-End development. 
      I work with many languages, frameworks and technologies."
